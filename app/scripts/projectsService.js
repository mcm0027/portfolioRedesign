I  use CSS media queries and conditional statements in JavaScript to make the site responsive for multiple devices and screen sizes. The navbar is loaded as traditional links on desktop and tablet sized screens and as a hamburger dropdown on cell phone sized screens. Different image aspect ratios are loaded depending on the aspect ratio of the device screen. Also, inline CSS styling is included in the header to reduce load times on all devices.',
                description2: 'The site also incorporates some animations using Velocity.js to create a lazy loading effect and a bounce effect on the CTA button to draw attention to the element and reinforce that it is interactive to the user. The carousel is a restyled version of the Slick JQuery plugin, and Jquery Inview is providing inview detection for the animation event triggers. The project demonstrates a responsive design from scratch without the use of a bootstrap template.',

This is done with multiple API calls per page that use the $q and $http Angular services to get information in a factory, which is then passed into controllers specific to each view.

Every attempt alerts the user of their accuracy with conditional text indicating whether their new guess is closer or further away from their last guess and how close their guess is in general. When the user guesses correctly, a modal is displayed indicating the number of guesses made and allowing the user to restart.
